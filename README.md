# WARNING: Do not use!
Modern computers do not need such maintenance (like CCleaner and whatnot), and it is doubtful this will help any older ones either. Do not use this or programs like this. If you are having an issue, find the most specific way to solve it. Surgeons use scalpels, not jackhammers, and that is absolutely valid in this case as well. I am only leaving this up because I made it when I was much much younger (around Christmas of 2015) and maybe I can show my kids how dumb I was at their age if I ever have any :)
